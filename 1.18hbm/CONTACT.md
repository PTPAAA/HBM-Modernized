# Contact

If you'd like to reach out to the developer or just hang out with others, you may use any of these options:

- [Matrix](#matrix) ([#nucleartech-space:ntmr.dev](https://matrix.to/#/#nucleartech-space:ntmr.dev), [#nucleartech:ntmr.dev](https://matrix.to/#/#nucleartech:ntmr.dev) or [@martinthedragon:ntmr.dev](https://matrix.to/#/@martinthedragon:ntmr.dev))
- [Discord](#discord) (Invite link: <https://discord.gg/XDrARD2FaJ>)
- [E-Mail](#e-mail) (<mailto:martin@ntmr.dev>)

### Original Source Notice

If you have received a copy of this project from somewhere other than at <https://codeberg.org/MartinTheDragon/Nuclear-Tech-Mod-Remake>,
this is probably a fork made by another person, and I, MartinTheDragon, am likely not the one you should contact if you experience any issues.
Should contact options not have been changed accordingly, you will have to find ways to contact the author of the modified version yourself.

<!--
## Info for authors of modified versions

The section above named "Original Source Notice" must be preserved in all modified versions of this project, as it is an Invariant Section.
If you are the author of a modified version, you may add an Invariant Section of your own under a different name, stating a similar disclaimer.
For more information, see the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.

## Matrix

Join our space at [#nucleartech-space:ntmr.dev](https://matrix.to/#/#nucleartech-space:ntmr.dev), the main room at [#nucleartech:ntmr.dev](https://matrix.to/#/#nucleartech:ntmr.dev), or contact me directly at [@martinthedragon:ntmr.dev](https://matrix.to/#/@martinthedragon:ntmr.dev)!

### Details

[Matrix](https://matrix.org) is a secure, decentralized, open network for communication.
Basically, every user has their own so-called homeserver, which their client communicates with.

If you want to send a message to someone else on another homeserver, both of these homeservers will communicate with each other and exchange data. This process is called "federation".
It works a bit like E-Mail, except it's instant messaging with real end-to-end-encryption.

Do note though that, due to the very nature of how this works, deleting messages and user accounts isn't a simple task.
It's not guaranteed that every homeserver that is connected to ours will honor requests to delete your data, and as such, true, verifiable message deletion is impossible.
On the flip-side, people would probably be horrified if you were able to delete emails from their inboxes. Simply be careful about what you send on the internet!

### Clients

A vast array of clients for different platforms exist. Approved ones can be found at <https://matrix.org/ecosystem/clients/>.

If you don't know what to choose, here's a bit of a list of personal, subjective, recommendations:

- [Element](https://element.io/) is the most popular choice.
- [Cinny](https://cinny.in/) is good if you want something a bit reminiscent of Discord and with a good bit of options.
- [FluffyChat](https://fluffychat.im/) is a good one if you like simplicity and a bit of theming (and cuteness!)
- [Nheko](https://nheko-reborn.github.io/) has support for most Matrix features, and quite a compact design.
- [NeoChat](https://invent.kde.org/network/neochat) is quite new, but aims to be fully-featured at some point. You may have to join `#ntm-general:ntmr.dev` directly until spaces get supported.
- [SchildiChat](https://schildi.chat/) is a fork of Element, but with a more traditional instant messaging experience.

## Discord

You can also reach out via this very popular chat service, at least for another few years.
Here's the invite link: <https://discord.gg/XDrARD2FaJ>

### Details

I don't think [Discord](https://discord.com/) needs much introduction, but due to lack of privacy, security, flexibility and an abundance of paid subscription content, I have decided to migrate over to [Matrix](#matrix), which makes me independent of any platform, as the corresponding rooms are hosted on my own server.
The Discord server will probably still be around until 2026-2030, unless some dramatic change happens that would require immediate migration.

## E-Mail

If you like none of the options above and just want to quickly contact me, or need to report some serious security vulnerability, you can also send emails to <mailto:martin@ntmr.dev>.
I do not constantly check emails however, so don't expect me to reply quickly.
For extra security, you may send a [PGP-encrypted](https://www.openpgp.org/) message that only I will be able to see using the public key below.
Clients like [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net) (really recommend that one) have the ability to properly send encrypted messages with OpenPGP keys out of the box.
